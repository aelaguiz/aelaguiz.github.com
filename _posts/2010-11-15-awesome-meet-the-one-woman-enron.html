Basically, she borrowed from Peter to pay Paul to buy a Lexus and never paid Peter back.</p> <p>She is accused filing false financial statements to borrow credit, buy natural gas from one company, and then sell it to another, without every paying back the first company. Investigators say she was able to avoid detection for so long because of the traders she had befriended during her days working in the back offices of Enron and Halliburton.</p> <p><a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCATRE6AE1VX20101115?sp=true">Special Report: Was a Houston energy trader a one-woman Enron?</a> [Reuters via <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/stephanie-rae-roqumore-energy-trader-oil-fraud-texas-2010-11">Clusterstock</a>]</p></div>
