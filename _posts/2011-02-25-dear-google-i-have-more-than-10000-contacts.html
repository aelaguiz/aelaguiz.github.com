				<p>I just received the “amusing email of the day” from Google. I feel like I’m in one step forward / one step back with Google Enterprise Support. If you read my two recent posts on this, you saw that I started by saying that it’s <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2011/01/time-for-google-to-get-serious-about-enterprise-tech-support.html">Time For Google To Get Serious About Enterprise Tech Support</a> and I followed up with <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2011/02/my-increasing-love-affair-with-google-apps.html">My Increasing Love Affair With Google Apps</a>.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I realized that Google was no longer allowing me to enter new contacts. When I checked Contacts in <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2008/04/what-exactly-is-google-app-engine.html?lc=int_mb_1001">Google Apps</a>, I saw I had exactly 10,000. That triggered some neuron in my brain to fire at which point I did a – ahem – Google search and quickly found that the Apps limit is 10,000 contacts. I complained to Ross (our IT guy) who sent Google the following email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>One of our users has hit some sort of limit of 10,000 contacts – we need this increased as this user needs more than 10,000. Can you let me know how to increase this limit?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early this morning Ross got the following response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hello <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2006/04/harry-ross-guest-vc-blogger.html?lc=int_mb_1001">Ross</a>,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your message. I understand that you are inquiring about the Contact limit per user for a <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2008/04/what-exactly-is-google-app-engine.html?lc=int_mb_1001">Google Apps</a> for Business account.</em></p>
<p><em>This is expected functionality at the moment and we suggest that you remove some of the contacts that you don’t use to free up some space on your account. You are not able to increase this amount, however if you would like you can submit a feature request for increasing the amount of Contacts each user has. To do this please follow these instructions</em></p>
<p><em>1. Login to your Google Apps account.</em></p>
<p><em>2. In your dashboard, scroll down to the very bottom on the screen and you will see a link called ‘Suggest a Feature.’</em></p>
<p><em>3. Click on this link and you will be able to fill out a feature request.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you found this information useful, <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2006/04/harry-ross-guest-vc-blogger.html?lc=int_mb_1001">Ross</a> and thank you for your understanding.</em></p>

<p>Dear <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/tag/google?lc=int_mb_1001">Google</a>, no, this is not helpful. While part of me fantasizes about never meeting anyone again in the future that I’d want to put in my Contact database (that’s the introvert part of me), my business dictates that I meet lots of new people every week. And CardMunch is relentless about munching their business cards and putting it in my <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2008/04/dead-address-book-entries.html?lc=int_mb_1001">Address Book</a> (or – well – Contact Database). And – you are now the source repository for all of these dudes and dudettes!</p>
<p>I can’t imagine any particularly good reason why 10,000 would be the limit, or that I couldn’t simply pay you money (I will!) to get 20,000. Yeah, that seems like plenty – how about 20,000? Yeah, I know, we’ll never need more than 64K of RAM in a computer.</p>
