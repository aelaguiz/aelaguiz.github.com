<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">via <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/" class="f">Techdirt</a> by Mike Masnick on 2/14/11</div>
<br style="display: none;" /> You may recall late last year that the state of Texas sent Amazon a tax bill for <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101024/23215811557/texas-sends-amazon-269m-sales-tax-bill-could-woot-have-pushed-texas-over-the-edge.shtml">$269 million</a>. The issue, as always, is the question of whether or not Amazon has to collect sales tax. Technically, e-commerce companies have always said they don't have to collect sales tax in states where they have no physical presence. Of course, Amazon actually has a giant distribution facility in Texas, and also bought Woot (based in Texas) last summer. It's still tried to avoid the tax issue by claiming those are subsidiaries, not Amazon.com itself. <p /> Apparently, that strategy wasn't working, so last week Amazon <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20110210-amazon.com-shutting-irving-office-over-tax-dispute.ece">announced that it was leaving Texas</a> over the issue, making sure to announce that it had planned to hire 1,000 additional workers at the facility. Hearing a major employer leaving the state is generally a pretty bad thing for state politicians and Governor Rick Perry realized that, because it took all of one day for him to <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/2011/02/rick-perry-amazon-decision-wasnt-right-one">throw the state comptroller under the bus</a> and claim that the whole thing was a mistake by the comptroller:
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><em> "That is a problem and I would suggest to you that we need to look at that decision that our comptroller made," he said. "The comptroller made that decision independently. I would tell you from my perspective that's not the decision I would have made." </em></blockquote>
In fact, Perry publicly began to explain why Amazon shouldn't have to pay sales tax on items shipped in Texas:
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><em> "You couldn't go in and buy anything out of that store, and that, historically, has been the way we defined whether you pay taxes or not -- if you had a storefront. This obviously didn't have a store front. It was specifically there to manage products that need to be shipped out." </em></blockquote>
Perry then asked the state legislature to make sure that it crafts some new rules that keep Amazon from leaving. Looks like Amazon just successfully called Texas' bluff.<p /><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110211/17415913064/amazon-announces-its-leaving-texas-tax-dispute-governor-blames-comptroller-says-hell-fix.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110211/17415913064/amazon-announces-its-leaving-texas-tax-dispute-governor-blames-comptroller-says-hell-fix.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110211/17415913064/amazon-announces-its-leaving-texas-tax-dispute-governor-blames-comptroller-says-hell-fix.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><p />  <br style="clear: both;" /> <img src="http://segment-pixel.invitemedia.com/pixel?code=TechBiz&amp;partnerID=167&amp;key=segment" border="0" height="0" alt="" width="0" />
