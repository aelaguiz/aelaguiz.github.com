The magazine started by calculating the number of Facebook and LinkedIn users per capita, and then determined the overall Twitter usage. The study also included Myspace, Friendster, Reddit and Digg. As a final point, after factoring in the number of households that tend to use chat rooms and blogs, Men’s Health came up with the results.</p> <p><span></span></p> <p>I was surprised that Washington, D.C. was crowned the top socially networking city. I guess politicians need to be top of their constituents and minute-minute votes on Capitol Hill. Palo Alto, the home to Facebook headquarters, is nowhere to be found on the top 100 social networked cities.</p> <p>Atlanta and Denver are next in line, which I find interesting because, although Atlanta is a large city, I would have guessed San Francisco (#6) or New York (#53). My city, Sacramento, place better than the two metropolitan cities, came in eighteenth place. Sacramento did even better than Los Angeles (#33) where I thought Hollywood deals were made on Facebook.</p> <p>All kidding aside, the 100 socially networked cities list is worth looking over and contemplating “How so!” I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially, if you city is in the top ten, which I include in this post.</p> <p>1 Washington, DC</p> <p>2 Atlanta, GA</p> <p>3 Denver, CO</p> <p>4 Minneapolis, MN</p> <p>5 Seattle, WA</p> <p>6 San Francisco, CA</p> <p>7 Orlando, FL</p> <p>8 Austin, TX</p> <p>9 Boston, MA</p> <p>10 Salt Lake City, UT</p> <p><iframe marginheight="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/0i0bnt68b20topcqk89mjhlbv8/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.socialtimes.com%2F2011%2F03%2Ftop-100-socially-networked-cities%2F" frameborder="0" height="280" width="100%"></iframe></p><div> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/socialtimes?a=H-Uk7vKb1OI:yDcFHXchS4E:pnQdOprp5To"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/socialtimes?d=pnQdOprp5To" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/socialtimes?a=H-Uk7vKb1OI:yDcFHXchS4E:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/socialtimes?i=H-Uk7vKb1OI:yDcFHXchS4E:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/socialtimes?a=H-Uk7vKb1OI:yDcFHXchS4E:7Q72WNTAKBA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/socialtimes?d=7Q72WNTAKBA" border="0" /></a> </div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/socialtimes/~4/H-Uk7vKb1OI" height="1" width="1" /></div>
