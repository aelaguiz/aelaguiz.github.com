<p>Released a quick and dirty port of twitter's "murder" bittorrent based deployment system to python in API form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Super useful for quickly deploying builds to a cluster of machines on ec2 from my python build system. It's not pretty but it's functional and I only put half of a day into it, so I'm happy with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needs packaging, etc. Too lazy atm and it is just a utility for my actual project. I might come back to it.</p>
