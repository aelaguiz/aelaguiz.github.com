      <blockquote><div>
			<p>If I can only teach my kids one lesson, it would be to hang around with people who get shit done. Now, my kids are still young, so I am more likely to phrase it as “make friends with people who do cool stuff”. That would also give us the opportunity to talk about what cool stuff is.</p>
<p>Getting straight As on every report card? Yeah, that is pretty cool.<br />
Building a model of the Eifel Tower out of toothpicks for the science fair? That is definitely cool.<br />
Getting air on a 10 foot tall ramp with a skateboard? Also cool.</p>
<p>I believe that everyone can do amazing things, but unfortunately most of us don’t.  Why is that? The reasons are varied, but in my life I have found that hanging around people who are doing amazing things makes me try harder to do amazing things.</p>
<p>This is what makes places like the <a href="http://entrepreneurcenter.com">Entrepreneur Center</a> so great. By collecting a group of high-achievers all in the same workspace, it raises the bar for each person comparing themselves against their peers. It is also why some teams are way more productive than others.</p>
<p>The converse is true as well: Ditch the people who don’t do shit.</p>
