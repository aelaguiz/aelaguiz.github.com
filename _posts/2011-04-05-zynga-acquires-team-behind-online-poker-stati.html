				<p><img src="http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/marketzero.png" height="65" width="283" />The Zynga talent acquisition machine rolls on today, as the social gaming giant buys yet another gaming team. Today, Zynga is announcing the acquisition of the team from <a href="http://marketzeroinc.com/index.html">MarketZero</a>, who is behind the largest online portal tracking career statistics of online poker players, <a href="http://www.pokertableratings.com/">PokerTableRatings</a>. It’s important to note that Zynga is hiring the team behind <a href="http://marketzeroinc.com/index.html">MarketZero,</a> but will not operating or acquiring MarketZero’s existing business.</p>
<p>MarketZero’s founders include Gustavo Abdala, Amir Elaguizy, Nir Leibovich, Timothy Sullivan and Jason Wang. We hear the team will work for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Zynga-Poker/141094772576049">Zynga Poker</a> and will help develop new and innovative features within the game.</p>
<p>It should be interesting to see if the new team will add some of the interactive features that were developed through MarketZero’s platform. For example, PokerTableRatings’ tools help poker players maximize their online profits through a real time Table Selector, Player Research Tool, a Buddy List with Email Alerts, and other reports. We’re told that PokerTableRatings.com will continue to be owned and operated by a separate entity and all of the user accounts on PokerTableRatings.com will be unaffected by the acquisition. </p>
