Fuck all of you. <p /> Seriously. I'm sick of encountering a different one for every <br />project...I've had to learn autotools, scons, cmake, waf-script, plus <br />a thousand other mechanisms which ostensibly "help" me but really just <br />piss me the hell off. Seriously I just want to change  compiler <br />flag WHY DO I HAVE TO READ 20 PAGES OF DOCUMENTATION? <p /> Love, <br />Amir
