      <blockquote><div>
            <p>For those of us who use Flex everyday and were drawn to it by the promise of a fantastic framework to build complex non trivial applications using Actionscript, a language we admire, this post is shocking.</p>
<p>What you have told us here has much wider implications than the Flash player being dropped in mobile browsers and TV news released earlier this week.  With all due respect to the Flex team, I love your work very much after all, presenting the serious Actionscript development community and heavily invested in Flex business community with this news on this blog feels like sneaking it out a side door.</p>
<p>There are now more questions than ever.  Those of us who have been standing tall in front of clients and colleagues, and in my case a university degree course content committee, are already feeling a little foolish for being so passionate about a house built, it seems, on sand. How can we possible go to work on Monday continuing to champion Flex/Air in the way that we have been in the past, especially over the past year?</p>
<p>This week I have been asking myself what does Actionscript, Flex and Air bring to Adobe;</p>
<p>- the ability to make money selling tooling, eg.  Flash Pro, Flash Builder?</p>
<p>- the ability to make money from enterprise level content delivery, eg. Flash Media Server?</p>
<p>- a technology to build other product lines?  </p>
<p>The new Touch Apps are based on Air but they also leverage native extensions.  Would Adobe’s goal going forward to be to improve Air where they themselves recognise it can be improved for very serious application development or is Air to be treated as a thin Company wrapper around native Java and C in these products?  To me the fact that Air is not championed at all on the front Touch Apps page (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/touchapps.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/products/touchapps.html</a>) is very telling.  If you are really 100% behind the Air runtime why miss this amazing bit of press.  That’s the type of thing that we can point our clients, colleagues and nay sayers everywhere to?</p>
<p>What happens when activities like these three prove to not be profitable, everything changes eventually after all?  Would Adobe continue to show love to the Air runtime if all it does is cost the company money?  There may a certain kudos by owning the real estate that this fantastic run time provides but Adobe is a public company and is driven by the priorities that all public companies are.  </p>
<p>Adobe is not a technology company in the same way that Sun is.  I feel Sun is more similar to say IBM who would more inclined to recognise the broader benefit to technology at large by being the custodian of a run time that other people can make a living off.  Adobe feels like a company that enjoys glamour and the font stage spotlights, more than it identifies with geeks getting kicks out of shaving milliseconds off of compile times.  Take a look at the video of Anirudh Sasikumar presenting some amazing tech at Adobe Max 2011 and pay attention to the comments of the hosts for clear evidence of this. <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5hyI8yKTOmQ?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p>The roadmap for Air in my head seems to be.  HTML5 replaces MXML.  In some way this isn’t the end of the world.  Why have two mark ups that do similar things?  The downside being that HTML5 is not there yet (which in itself points to questions about the timing of all of this) and it’s also designed to be a markup for web pages served over HTTP.  Would all view components need to be a WebView instance or the Display List replaced with a WebView DOM?  This is starting to sound crazy.  As pointed out by a community member on Twitter loads of things have been sounding crazy this week; </p>
<p>“How stupid can Adobe be – Flash for application development on mobile phones, but HTML5 for ‘Enterprise Applications’ on the desktop – WTF?”</p>
<p>His heart’s in it, all of ours are.  You guys are not coming out with anything specific and we are feeling pretty frustrated that the great technology we love is being treated this way.     </p>
<p>Going forward do we then get Air for people wanting to build view components with HTML5 using AS3 and PhoneGap for those wanting to do the same but using JS?  That only ends in one thing PhoneGap and Air get merged which leaves the biggest question for me.</p>
<p>What is going to happen to Actionscript?</p>
<p>I am probably not thinking about that roadmap in quite the same way that an Adobe engineer might but that’s the point.  We need to know what the thinking is.  We need to be convinced that this has actually been thought through and you know what the thinking is.</p>
<p>I agree 100% with Curtis Fisher (above) when he says :</p>
<p>“I am a believer in Open Source, but the FLEX SDK is already Open Source, so I see this as more an act of dumping a product line rather than contributing to a community.”</p>
<p>With that attitude in mind for me the best case scenario, and probably only saving move, now is open source the whole Flash eco system.  Everything.  Make it an open standard.  Flash Player, Air Runtime the whole family of technologies without exception.  Work very hard to push for the long term survival of the platform.  </p>
<p>Adobe continues to make money out of tooling and other services around the Flash platform, after all they are best placed to do it, but as their interest in this technology wanes at least there is a chance of life from somewhere else.</p>
<p>If you don’t do this all it seems to me Adobe is doing is strangling the Flash platform for every ounce of breath that it can before turning it’s back sometime in the future when it is done.</p>
